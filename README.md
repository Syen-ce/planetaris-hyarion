A planet made from crystals and lava, light refraction rays fall from the sky and destroys the surface.

### Polishing

Polish raw gemstones to produce new and more dangerous ones, you will need the polisher and polishing compound. Gems are mined from geodes found all over hyarion using a new mining drill.

# Planetaris unbounded

Planetaris unbounded is a bigger mod that merges all planetaris planets, Hyarion is the second planet of the development and depends on the planet Arig to work.

I'm completely open to suggestions and ideas. :)
